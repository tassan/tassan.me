            <p>Imagine you're on branch A, but you need to update your master/main branch, whatever your motive may be,
                and
                then, you want to get back to your working branch. Well, this is what you should do:</p>

            <p>On Branch A:</p>

            <code>
            git stash
            <br>
            git switch master/main
            </code>

            <p>On Branch Master/Main:</p>

            <code>
                git pull
            <br>
                git switch branch-a
            <br>
            </code>


            <p>Now here is the trick, if you do a git status, git will problaby say this:</p>

            <blockquote class="terminal">
                On branch branch-a <br>
                Your branch is up to date with 'origin/branch-a'.

                nothing to commit, working tree clean
            </blockquote>

            <p>Which is true, for instance, if you use: <code>git log --oneline</code>, you'll see your last commit
                listed
                first, as if any
                of your previous work was lost. But, don't panic. Now you just have to “unstash” your work using:</p>

            <code>git stash pop</code>

            <p>And git will prompt all your work items, that you thought you've lost.</p>
